            Cayenne Release Notes 1.0.1 
                 Date: October 13, 2003
         ============================================

For the latest information go to the project web site at

1. Fixed handling of to-one dependent relationships. Right now
   they no longer require special "set/get" methods in the DataObject,
   so "readToOneDependentTarget" and "setToOneDependentTarget" are deprecated.
   
   Note that due to a bug in class generation, these methods weren't used by
   DataObjects to begin with, so no class regeneration is required to take advantage
   of this fix.

2. Fixed handling of to-one faults for flattened to-one relationships. Previously
   Cayenne would not guarantee uniquing for the objects obtained via
   such relationships. [Bug 813413]
   
3. Fixed CayenneDataObject.readNestedProperty() always returning Strings for
   non-persistent property values, even if the target property has a different
   class. [Bug 817449]
   
4. Generating correct SQL for case insensitive ordering (column list must include 
   UPPER(column_name) for all ordering columns that use case-insensitive ordering.
   Patch was submitted by Scott Finnerty.
