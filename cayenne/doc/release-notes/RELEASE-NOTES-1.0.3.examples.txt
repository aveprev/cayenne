         ============================================

For the latest information go to the project web site at
http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/


1. This Examples release uses the new examples format, when examples source is 
distributed separately, with build files, and documentation is distributed with
the main cayenne download (and is therefore present on the website).

2. Cayenne Aggregate Functions Example is added.
